# Perovksite_solar_cell_stability_file
A dataset of 527 datapoints for Analyzing the stability of Perovskite solar cells on the basis of 14 independent variables
These parameters are experimentally based and dependent on ambient conditions.
Further, a Machine learning technique is implemented to predict and analyze perovskite-based solar cells' stability time exposure.
